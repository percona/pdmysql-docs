Percona Distribution for MySQL is a single solution with the most critical enterprise components from the MySQL open source community, designed and tested to work together.

Percona Distribution for MySQL provides two deployment variants: one is based on *Percona Server for MySQL* and another one is based on *Percona XtraDB Cluster*. 

This release of Percona Distribution for MySQL is focused on the *Percona XtraDB Cluster*-based deployment variant. It is based on [Percona XtraDB Cluster 8.0.28-19.1](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-xtradb-cluster/8.0/release-notes/Percona-XtraDB-Cluster-8.0.28-19.1.html)

## Release Highlights

The following lists a number of the bug fixes for *MySQL* 8.0.28, provided by Oracle, and included in Percona XtraDB Cluster and Percona Distribution for MySQL:


* The ``ASCII`` shortcut for ``CHARACTER SET latin1`` and ``UNICODE`` shortcut for ``CHARACTER SET ucs2`` are deprecated and raise a warning to use ``CHARACTER SET`` instead. The shortcuts will be removed in a future version.
* A stored function and a loadable function with the same name can share the same namespace. Add the schema name when invoking a stored function in the shared namespace. The server generates a warning when function names collide.
* InnoDB supports ``ALTER TABLE ... RENAME COLUMN`` operations when using ``ALGORITHM=INSTANT``. 
* The limit for ``innodb_open_files`` now includes temporary tablespace files. The temporary tablespace files were not counted in the ``innodb_open_files`` in previous versions.
