# Percona Distribution for MySQL 8.0.43 using Percona XtraDB Cluster (2025-09-22)

Percona Distribution for MySQL is more than just a version of MySQL; it is a comprehensive solution that combines Percona Server for MySQL with additional tools to create a cohesive environment. This distribution is reliable, scalable, and secure, ensuring that all components have been tested to work seamlessly together. You can choose from two download options: one that uses Percona Server for MySQL and another that utilizes Percona XtraDB Cluster. Refer to [Install Percona Distribution for MySQL](installing.md).

This release is focused on the Percona XtraDB Cluster-based deployment variation. It is based on [Percona XtraDB Cluster 8.0.43-34](https://docs.percona.com/percona-xtradb-cluster/8.0/release-notes/8.0.43-34.html).

## Release highlights

Percona XtraDB Cluster is based on Percona Server for MySQL. Find a complete list of improvements and bug fixes in the [Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.43-34 (2025-08-28) release notes](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server/8.0/release-notes/8.0.43-34.html).

### Percona XtraDB Cluster 8.0.43-34

Improves State Snapshot Transfer (SST) failure diagnostics. `garbd` now uses distinct exit codes to differentiate between donor exit, SST script failure, and garbd-initiated termination, making SST issues easier to identify and debug.

### Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.43-34

* Improves the `audit_log_filter_set_user()` UDF to accept account names with wildcard characters (`'%'` and `'_'`) in the host part. For example, you can use `‘usr1@%'`, `‘usr2%192.168.0.%’`, or `'usr3@%.mycorp.com'`.

* Updates the C++ level of the KMPI library to enhance error handling capabilities.

* Improves optimizer behavior by restoring correct handling of const tables in `test_quick_select()`. A MySQL Upstream refactor (commit [9a13c1c](https://github.com/percona/percona-server/commit/9a13c1c6971f4bd56d143179ecfb34cca8ecc018)) removed the `QEP_TAB` dependency, causing `get_quick_record_count()` to no longer pass const table information. This could lead to suboptimal range scan boundaries. The applied patch resolves the issue by explicitly passing `const_tables` to `test_quick_select()`, ensuring consistent behavior with the pre-refactor logic.

### MySQL 8.0.43

Improvements and bug fixes provided by Oracle for MySQL 8.0.43 and included in Percona Server for MySQL are the following:

* Fixed an issue where `CHECK TABLE` sometimes incorrectly reported that spatial indexes were corrupted. (Bug #37286473)

* Fixed an issue in InnoDB redo log recovery to improve data safety after a crash. (Bug #37061960)

* Fixed an issue where reading `index_id` values could lead to incorrect behavior with indexes. (Bug #36993445, Bug #37709706)

* Fixed a bug related to the `lower_case_table_names` setting that caused inconsistent behavior with table names on different systems. (Bug #32288105)

* Fixed a bug where `mysqldump` did not properly escape certain special characters in its output. (Bug #37540722, Bug #37709163)

* The `fprintf_string()` function in `mysqldump` did not use the correct quote character for escaping strings. (Bug #37607195)
