# Upgrade Percona Distribution for MySQL

Minor releases include bug fixes and feature enhancements. We recommend to have Percona Distribution for MySQL updated to the latest version.

Though minor releases donâ€™t change the behavior, even a minor upgrade is a risky process. We recommend to back up your data before upgrading.

## Preconditions

To upgrade Percona Distribution for MySQL, [install the `percona-release` repository management tool](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-repo-config/installing.html) or [update it](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-repo-config/updating.html) to the latest version.

## Procedure

!!! important

    Run the following commands as the root user or via `sudo`.
