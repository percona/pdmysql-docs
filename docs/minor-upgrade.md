# Upgrading Percona Distribution for MySQL

Minor releases include bug fixes and feature enhancements. We recommend to have Percona Distribution for MySQL updated to the latest version.

Though minor releases donâ€™t change the behavior, even a minor upgrade is a risky process. We recommend to back up your data before upgrading.

As with installing Percona Distribution for MySQL, the recommended way to upgrade it is from Percona repositories.

!!! admonition "Assumptions"

    We assume that you have [installed](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-repo-config/installing.html) or [updated](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-repo-config/updating.html) `percona-release` utility to the latest version.

## Enable Percona repository

The Major Release repository automatically includes new version packages of Percona Distribution for MySQL. If you installed Percona Distribution for MySQL from a Minor Release repository, enable the new version repository:

```
$ sudo percona-release setup pdps-XXX 
```

or

```
$ sudo percona-release setup pdpxc-XXX 
```

where `XXX` is the required version.

Read more about major and Minor release repositories in [Repository overview](installing.md).
