# Upgrade Percona Distribution for MySQL

Minor releases include bug fixes and feature enhancements. We recommend to have Percona Distribution for MySQL updated to the latest version.

Though minor releases donâ€™t change the behavior, even a minor upgrade is a risky process. We recommend to back up your data before upgrading.

## Preconditions

To upgrade Percona Distribution for MySQL, [install the `percona-release` repository management tool](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-repo-config/installing.html) or [update it](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-repo-config/updating.html) to the latest version.

## Procedure

!!! important

    Run the following commands as the root user or via `sudo`.


1. Enable Percona repository

    The Major Release repository automatically includes new version packages of Percona Distribution for MySQL. If you installed Percona Distribution for MySQL from a Minor Release repository, enable the new version repository:

    ```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
    $ sudo percona-release setup pdps-XXX 
    ```

    where `XXX` is the required version.

    Read more about major and Minor release repositories in [Repository overview](installing.md).

2. Stop `mysql` service 

    ```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
    $ sudo systemctl mysql stop
    ```
