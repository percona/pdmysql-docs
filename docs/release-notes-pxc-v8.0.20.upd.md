Percona Distribution for MySQL is a single solution with the best and most critical enterprise components from the MySQL open source community, designed and tested to work together.

Percona Distribution for MySQL provides two deployment variants: one is based on *Percona Server for MySQL* and another one is based on *Percona XtraDB Cluster*. This enables you to choose the MySQL deployment approach that best meets your specific needs. Each variant is available via its own repository and includes the base server (*Percona Server for MySQL* or *Percona XtraDB Cluster*) and compatible components.

This update to the Percona Distribution for MySQL using *Percona XtraDB Cluster* fixes the security vulnerability [CVE-2020-15180](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15180). It is based on *Percona XtraDB Cluster* 8.0.20-11.2.
