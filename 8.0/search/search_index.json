Whenever a package is updated, the package manager of your operating system detects that and prompts you to update.

You may choose to install Percona Distribution for MySQL from the Minor Release repository if you have decided to standardize on a particular release which has passed rigorous testing procedures and which has been verified to work with your applications. This allows you to deploy to a new host and ensure that you\u2019ll be using the same version of all the Distribution packages, even if newer releases exist in other repositories.</p> <p>The disadvantage of using a Minor Release repository is that you are locked in this particular release.

With this fixed, a <code>FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK</code> is performed before the fetching of <code>GTID_EXECUTED</code> to ensure its value is consistent with the snapshot taken by <code>mysqldump</code>.</p> <p>The MySQL fix also added a requirement when using \u2013single-transaction and executing FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK for the RELOAD privilege.

This is a failover that has been scheduled in advance or occurs at a regular interval. There can be many reasons for planned failovers including patching, large data operations, retiring existing infrastructure, or simply to test the failover strategy.</p> </li> <li> <p>Unplanned failover. This is what occurs when a database has unexpectedly become unresponsive or experiences instability. An unplanned failover could also include emergency changes that do not fall under the planned failover cadence or scheduling parameters. Unplanned failovers are generally considered higher risk operations due to the high stress and high potential for data corruption or data fragmentation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Regional or disaster recovery (DR) failover. Unplanned failovers still work with the assumption that additional database infrastructure is immediately available and in a usable state.

Uptime is composed of three key components and, contrary to common perception, is based on what happens when the database software cannot take incoming requests rather than maintain the ability to take requests with errors.</p> <p>The uptime components are:</p> <ul> <li>Recovery Time Objective (RTO)</li> </ul> <p>RTO can be characterized by a simple question \u201cHow long can the business sustain a database outage?\u201d Once the business is aligned with a minimum viable recovery time objective, it is much more straightforward to plan and invest in the infrastructure required to meet that requirement. It is important to acknowledge that while everyone desires 100% uptime, there need to be realistic expectations that align with the business needs and not a technical desire.</p> <ul> <li>Recovery Point Objective (RPO)</li> </ul> <p>There is a big distinction between the Recovery Point and the Recovery Time for a database infrastructure. The database can be available, but not to the exact state that it was when it became unavailable. That is where Recovery Point comes in. The question to ask here is \u201cHow much data can the business lose during a database outage?\u201d All businesses have their own requirements here yet it is always the goal to never sustain any data loss. But this is framed in the worst case scenario, how much data could be lost and the business maintains the ability to continue.</p> <ul> <li>Disaster recovery</li> </ul> <p>RTO and RPO are great for unplanned outages or small scale hiccups to the infrastructure. Disaster recovery is a major large scale outage not strictly for the database infrastructure. How capable is the business of restarting operations with the assumption that all resources are completely unavailable in the main availability zone? The assumption here is that there is no viable restoration point or time that aligns with the business requirements. While each disaster recovery scenario is unique based on available infrastructure, backup strategy and technology stack, there are some common threads for any scenario.</p> <p>The described solution helps improve uptime. It will help you to significantly reduce both RPO and RTO. Given the tightly coupled cluster solution approach, the failure of a single node will not result in service interruption.</p> <p>Increasing the number of nodes will also improve the cluster resilience by the formula:</p> <pre><code>F = (N -1) / 2\n</code></pre> <p>where:</p> <ul> <li> <p><code>F</code> is the number of admissible failures</p> </li> <li> <p><code>N</code> is the number of nodes in the cluster.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"solutions/pdps-group-replication.html#example","title":"Example","text":"<ul> <li> <p>In a cluster of 5 nodes, F = (5 - 1)/2 = 2.
