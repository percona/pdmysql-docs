|pdmysql| is a single solution with the best and most critical enterprise components from the |mysql| open source community, designed and tested to work together. 

|pdmysql| provides two deployment variants: one is based on |PS| and another one is based on |PXC|. This enables you to choose the |mysql| deployment approach that best meets your specific needs. Each variant is available via its own repository and includes the base server (|PS| or |PXC|) and compatible :ref:`components <pdmysql.components>`.

This release of |pdmysql| is focused on the |PS|-based deployment variant and is based on `Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.22-13 <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/8.0/release-notes/Percona-Server-8.0.22-13.html>`_.
