|pdmysql| is a single solution with the best and most critical enterprise components from the |mysql| open source community, designed and tested to work together. 

|pdmysql| provides two deployment variants: one is based on |PS| and another one is based on |PXC|. 

This release of |pdmysql| is focused on the |PXC|-based deployment variant. It is based on `Percona XtraDB Cluster 8.0.27-17.1 <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-xtradb-cluster/8.0/release-notes/Percona-XtraDB-Cluster-8.0.27-17.1.html>`_ 

Release Highlights
==================

The following lists a number of the bug fixes for *MySQL* 8.0.27, provided by Oracle, and included in Percona Server for MySQL:

* The ``default_authentication_plugin`` is deprecated. Support for this plugin may be removed in future versions. Use the ``authentication_policy`` variable.
* The ``binary`` operator is deprecated. Support for this operator may be removed in future versions. Use ``CAST(... AS BINARY)``.
* Fix for when a parent table initiates a cascading ``SET NULL`` operation on the child table, the virtual column can be set to NULL instead of the value derived from the parent table.
